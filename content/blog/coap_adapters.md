A new protocol is now supported in WLDT through the introduction of CoAP Adapters!
The CoAP Digital and Physical Adapters enable seamless integration between Digital Twins and CoAP-based applications or physical assets.

For more information, check out the documentation:

- [CoAP Digital Adapter Documentation](/docs/adapters/coap_digital/)
- [CoAP Physical Adapter Documentation](/docs/adapters/coap_physical/)

These new adapters are supported starting from WLDT version 0.4.0.

We believe these new adapters will significantly enhance the capabilities of WLDT in IoT and resource-constrained environments. Stay tuned for more updates and features in future releases!
